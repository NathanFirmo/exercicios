This is a repository for storing exercises in different languages and different difficulties.
The idea is to keep here, everything I learn, and to be able to revisit whenever I have any questions or are creating a new application.

 ## *[Node.js](https://github.com/NathanFirmo/exercicios/tree/main/Node.js/)* folder 
Here are the *back-end things*, I'm using *Node.js*.
